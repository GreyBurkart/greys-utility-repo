Markdown CV v0.1
==========
*init 2011-05-14*

Overview:
	This is old n00b code for building a PDF out of multiple markdown files. No point other than to show poor ways of getting around a script like this. Not flexible nor innovative.

Files:
* mdcv-setup.sh: Run this to set up the cv working directory
* mdcv-build.sh: Run this to compile and build the CV
* mdcv-reset.sh: Run this to restore the directory to pre-setup conditions

Dependencies:
	- Pandoc: http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/
	- A proper *nix backend (read: Linux/OS X); bash is used because the script reads "crunch! bang! bin! bash!"
	- (Knowledge of) Markdown

Nice to have:
	- MultiMarkdown
	- Full LaTeX library if you want to use templates with the *.tex file (hackery)
	- Git for version control (if you dl'd this script, you probably have git) and for maintaining multiple CV versions

Workflow:
Step 1: Draft in separate markdown (*.md) files per area

Step 2: Run script to compile into single *.mmd and process to *.pdf
	Source format: *.md
	Output format: mdcv.md --> NAME-CV.pdf using Pandoc

Step 3: Cover letter + References

Extra Step: Build Script for directory structure.
